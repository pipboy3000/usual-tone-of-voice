This directory is reserved for app resources.
whisper.cpp is linked via an XCFramework, so no CLI binary is required.

If present, the app will prefer this bundled binary over system paths.

Menu bar icon override (optional):
- Add a template image named "menubar-icon" in this folder.
- Supported formats: pdf, png, tiff, icns.
- The icon is used when there is no error state.
